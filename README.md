# UtiliTab

## This project is abandoned. Maybe I'll come back to it later
This goal of this project was to have a bunch of utilities on the "new tab" page of the browser instead of it being blank.
A fun challenge was to code all the utilities from scratch and avoid using libraries or external apis.
